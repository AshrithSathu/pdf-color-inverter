## Installation

1. Visit the Chrome Web Store (link coming soon)
2. Click "Add to Chrome"
3. Confirm the installation

Or install manually:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ashrithsathu/pdf-color-inverter.git
   ```
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `dist` folder from the cloned repository

## Usage

1. Open any PDF file in Chrome
2. Click the PDF Color Inverter extension icon
3. Press the "Enable Dark Mode" button to invert colors
4. Press again to disable dark mode

The extension will automatically detect if you're viewing a PDF and enable/disable the toggle button accordingly.

## Development

This extension is built with:
- React + TypeScript for the UI
- Vite for building
- Chrome Extensions API

To set up the development environment:

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ashrithsathu/pdf-color-inverter.git
   cd pdf-color-inverter
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Build for production
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## How It Works

The extension uses the Chrome Extensions API to:
1. Detect when you're viewing a PDF file
2. Inject a transparent overlay with CSS mix-blend-mode
3. Invert the colors of the PDF content without affecting the UI

This approach ensures:
- Fast performance (no image processing)
- Compatibility with most PDF viewers
- Preservation of text selection and interaction
